Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Output: 
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08   | 840          | 120            |
| 2019-01-09   | 840          | 120            |
| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86

Approach and Explanation:
• To compute the moving average of the amount paid by customers over a seven-day window, we need to sum the amounts for each day and then calculate the average across the current day and the previous six days.
• The query should group the transactions by visited_on to aggregate the daily amounts.
• We can then join this result with itself to match each day with the previous six days using a date difference condition.
• After filtering to ensure we have exactly seven days in each window (HAVING COUNT(t2.visited_on) = 7), we calculate the sum of amounts and the rounded average using ROUND (AVG(t2.day_sum), 2).
• Finally, we order the results by visited_on in ascending order to display them chronologically.
• This approach ensures that we accurately compute the moving average for each day based on the preceding seven days of customer transactions.
  
-- Solutions
SELECT t1.visited_on AS visited_on,
SUM(t2.day_sum) AS amount,
ROUND(AVG(t2.day_sum), 2) AS average_amount
FROM (SELECT visited_on,
SUM(amount) AS day_sum
FROM Customer
GROUP BY visited_on) t1,
(SELECT visited_on,
SUM(amount) AS day_sum
FROM Customer
GROUP BY visited_on) t2
WHERE DATEDIFF(t1.visited_on, t2.visited_on) BETWEEN 0 AND 6
GROUP BY t1.visited_on
HAVING COUNT(t2.visited_on) = 7
ORDER BY t1.visited_on;
