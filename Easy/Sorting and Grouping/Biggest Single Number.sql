Table: MyNumbers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
Example 2:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

SELECT MAX(num) AS num /*Using aggregation function MAX to find max. no. from MyNumbers Table alias as num (show the column)... */
FROM MyNumbers /*Association from MyNumbers Table... */
WHERE num IN /*Using sub - query for num column... */
(SELECT num /* */
FROM MyNumbers /* */
GROUP BY num /*in sub - query we grouped w.r.t. num column... */
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1); /*Condition given in the problem...(Number should be single...) */
